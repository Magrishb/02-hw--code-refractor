## Acknowledgments

```
Initally, when I was given the task at hand, I was clueless. 
It took many Study Rooms and Breakout Rooms before I saw what the 
task required. After I saw a few examples from many different peers,
I had found a general idea of this assignment which I went and asked
google. I found everything I need and with a little playing around 
and a lot of peer reviews/help, I was able to work on this task to 
the best of my abilities. I would like to acknowledge my entire 
GTech BootCanp class and pod2!
